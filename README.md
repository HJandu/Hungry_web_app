This website was creating using VS Code, a local git directory was used for version control, and then uploaded to GitHub. We have made it live using Git pages. To do this we initiated the git repository with 'git innit', then used 'git status' to see which of my un-tracked files had not been added to the new repository. We used 'git commit -m "added in a specific message" to commit our changed files to the repository. Once our files were committed we used 'git push' to push all our new and changed files to GitHub before making it live with Git pages.
